# geoip-city [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/geoip-city.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/geoip-city)
==========

This product includes GeoLite2 ipv4 and ipv6 city data which created by MaxMind, available from https://www.maxmind.com.
The database of this product **updates weekly**.

**You should read this README and the LICENSE and EULA files carefully before deciding to use this product.**

This is the forked of [geoip-lite](https://github.com/bluesmoon/node-geoip).


## Synopsis

```javascript
var geoip = require('geoip-city');

var ip = "207.97.227.239";
var geo = geoip.lookup(ip);

console.log(geo);
{ range: [ 3479298048, 3479300095 ],
  country: 'US',
  region: 'TX',
  eu: '0',
  timezone: 'America/Chicago',
  city: 'San Antonio',
  ll: [ 29.4969, -98.4032 ],
  metro: 641,
  area: 1000,
  postalCode:  '04300'

```

## Installation

### 1. Install the library

    $ npm install geoip-city

### 2. Update MaxMind's geoip data

    $ npm run-script updatedb --license_key=YOUR_GEOLITE2_LICENSE_KEY
		or
    $ GEOLITE2_LICENSE_KEY=YOUR_GEOLITE2_LICENSE_KEY node scripts/updatedb.js

_YOUR_GEOLITE2_LICENSE_KEY should be replaced by a valid GeoLite2 license key. Please [follow instructions](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/) provided by MaxMind to obtain a license key._


## API

geoip-city is completely synchronous.  There are no callbacks involved.  All blocking file IO is done at startup time, so all runtime calls are executed in-memory and are fast.  Startup may take up to 200ms while it reads into memory and indexes data files.

### Looking up an IP address ###

If you have an IP address in dotted quad notation, IPv6 colon notation, or a 32 bit unsigned integer (treated
as an IPv4 address), pass it to the `lookup` method.  Note that you should remove any `[` and `]` around an
IPv6 address before passing it to this method.

```javascript
var geo = geoip.lookup(ip);
```

If the IP address was found, the `lookup` method returns an object with the following structure:

```javascript
{
   range: [ <low bound of IP block>, <high bound of IP block> ],
   country: 'XX',                 // 2 letter ISO-3166-1 country code
   region: 'RR',                  // Up to 3 alphanumeric variable length characters as ISO 3166-2 code
                                  // For US states this is the 2 letter state
                                  // For the United Kingdom this could be ENG as a country like â€œEngland
                                  // FIPS 10-4 subcountry code
   eu: '0',                       // 1 if the country is a member state of the European Union, 0 otherwise.
   timezone: 'Country/Zone',      // Timezone from IANA Time Zone Database
   city: "City Name",             // This is the full city name
   ll: [<latitude>, <longitude>], // The latitude and longitude of the city
   metro: <metro code>,           // Metro code
   area: <accuracy_radius>,       // The approximate accuracy radius (km), around the latitude and longitude
   postalCode:  '04300'           // Postal code
}
```

The actual values for the `range` array depend on whether the IP is IPv4 or IPv6 and should be
considered internal to `geoip-city`.
To get a human readable format, pass them to `geoip.pretty()`

If the IP address was not found, the `lookup` returns `null`


### Pretty printing an IP address ###

If you have a 32 bit unsigned integer, or a number returned as part of the `range` array from the `lookup` method,
the `pretty` method can be used to turn it into a human readable string.

```javascript
    console.log("The IP is %s", geoip.pretty(ip));
```

This method returns a string if the input was in a format that `geoip-city` can recognise, else it returns the
input itself.


## Built-in Updater

This package contains an update script that can pull the files from MaxMind and handle the conversion from CSV.
A npm script alias has been setup to make this process easy. Please keep in mind this requires internet and MaxMind
rate limits that amount of downloads on their servers.

```shell
npm run-script updatedb --license_key=YOUR_GEOLITE2_LICENSE_KEY
	or
GEOLITE2_LICENSE_KEY=YOUR_GEOLITE2_LICENSE_KEY node scripts/updatedb.js
```

_YOUR_GEOLITE2_LICENSE_KEY should be replaced by a valid GeoLite2 license key. Please [follow instructions](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/) provided by MaxMind to obtain a license key._
